This article explores a React application that utilizes the Grok API to create a basic chatbot interface. The application allows users to enter questions, which are then sent to Grok’s AI model for processing and generating a response.

Code

Understanding the Code
The code utilizes several key components:

Libraries:

React: Provides a framework for building user interfaces.
useState: A React hook for managing component state.
axios: A library for making HTTP requests to APIs.
State Variables:

question: Stores the user's entered question.
answer: Stores the response received from the Grok API.
isLoading: Indicates if the application is fetching a response.
Functions:

getAnswerFromAPI: Makes a POST request to the Grok API endpoint, sending the user question and retrieving the AI-generated response.
handleSubmit: Handles the form submission, triggering the API call and displaying loading and error messages as needed.
handleReset: Resets the question and answer fields.
handleQuestionChange: Updates the state with the user's entered question as they type.
API Interaction:

The application interacts with the Grok API using axios, sending the user question and model configuration details.
The configuration specifies the “grok-beta” model for text generation and sets the “temperature” parameter to 0 for a more factual response.
User Interface:

The application renders a simple interface consisting of:
A header displaying “Simple Chatbot”.
A large, read-only text area showcasing the AI response.
A smaller text area for users to enter their questions.
“Submit Question” and “Reset” buttons to interact with the chatbot.
Functionality Breakdown
When the user starts typing a question, the handleQuestionChange function updates the question state variable with the current text.

Clicking “Submit Question” triggers the handleSubmit function.

It checks if the question field is empty or contains only whitespace. If so, it exits without processing.
Otherwise, it sets isLoading to true and displays "Loading..." in the answer field.
It calls getAnswerFromAPI to send the question to Grok and retrieve the response.
Upon receiving a response from Grok:
On success:
It extracts the generated answer from the response and updates the answer state with the formatted (trimmed) text.
On failure:
It updates the answer state with an error message.
Finally, it sets isLoading back to false, indicating the request completion.

Clicking “Reset” triggers the handleReset function, clearing both the question and answer fields.

Running the Application
Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
A Grok API account with a valid access token stored in the environment variable REACT_APP_GROK_API_TOKEN.
Installation:

Clone or download the project code.
Run npm install or yarn install to install the required dependencies.
Running the App:

Run npm start or yarn start to start the development server.
The application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
Conclusion
This React application demonstrates a simple approach to integrating with an AI API for chatbot functionality. You can further enhance this application by:

Adding visual feedback for loading and error states.
Styling the UI for a more polished look and feel.
Exploring user experience improvements like question history or context retention.
This is a basic example, and integrating more advanced AI features or a different API would require further code modifications. However, it serves as a valuable starting point for building interactive chatbots with React and AI services.
