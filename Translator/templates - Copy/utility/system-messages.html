<th:block th:if="${message == 'core-charge'}">
    <p>
        Some products have a core charge associated with them. A core is some portion of a part that
        can be recycled or reused by the manufacturer. Doing this saves the manufacturer money and
        helps our environment. For this reason a product with a core has an additional charge
        associated with it. If the old part is returned in reusable condition, the core charge will
        be credited back to the card used to purchase the part. Please note: It is the customer's
        responsibility to pay any shipping cost associated with shipping a core back to
        OReillyAuto.com.

<th:block th:if="${message == 'why-taxes'}">
    <p>
        O&#8217;Reilly Auto Parts uses numerous supplier locations across the country for better
        service and lower cost. The presence of these shipping locations in numerous states requires
        us to collect taxes. This also requires us to calculate and collect all applicable state and
        local taxes based on your ship to location.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to our numerous shipping points we are usually able to get your parts to you faster and
        cheaper than our competitors.

<th:block th:if="${message == 'shipping-estimates'}">
    <p>
        Estimated delivery dates and order fulfillment time(s) are based off of company averages,
        and while we do our absolute best to get your items to you as quickly as possible, the
        actual delivery times may vary due to weather conditions, warehouse availability, etc. These
        times should be used as a reference and not a guarantee.

<th:block th:if="${message == 'battery-fees'}">
    <p>
        Some states require all retailers selling new or remanufactured lead-acid type batteries to
        collect a fee, varying by state. This fee applies to retailers of such products within the
        respective participating state, and assists the state in recycling the waste generated from
        these products. Examples of batteries subject to the fee include batteries for automobiles,
        pickups and small trucks, truck tractors, busses, motorcycles and motorized tri-cycles,
        construction equipment, recreational vehicles, and boats and boat/vessels.
